# Getting Started

Welcome to the exciting world of chess! In this section, we'll cover everything you need to know to get started playing the game, from setting up the chessboard to understanding the basic rules.

## Chessboard Setup

### The Chessboard
A chessboard consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. It's divided into alternating light and dark squares.

### Piece Placement
At the beginning of the game, each player places their pieces on the first two rows closest to them. The setup is as follows:
- The two players each have one row of eight pawns.
- Behind the pawns, from left to right, are placed: two rooks, two knights, two bishops, one queen, and one king.

## Piece Movement and Values

### Piece Movement
Each type of chess piece moves in a unique way:
- **Pawn**: Moves forward one square, but captures diagonally.
- **Rook**: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of squares.
- **Knight**: Moves in an "L" shape, two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to that.
- **Bishop**: Moves diagonally any number of squares.
- **Queen**: Moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.
- **King**: Moves one square in any direction.

### Piece Values
Each piece has a value, which helps in understanding their relative strength:
- Pawn: 1 point
- Knight: 3 points
- Bishop: 3 points
- Rook: 5 points
- Queen: 9 points
- King: Infinite value (as losing the king means losing the game)

## Basic Rules of Chess

### Objective
The goal of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king, which means putting the king in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.

### Special Moves
- **Castling**: A move where the king and one of the rooks are moved simultaneously.
- **En passant**: A pawn capture that can occur immediately after an opponent moves a pawn two squares forward from its starting position, bypassing the square where the capturing pawn would have been able to capture it had it only moved one square forward.
- **Pawn promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king).

### Check and Checkmate
- **Check**: When the king is under threat of capture on the opponent's next move.
- **Checkmate**: When the king is in check and there is no legal move that the player can make to escape check. This results in the game ending with a win for the opponent.

Now that you're familiar with the basics, it's time to start playing! Head over to the chessboard and put your newfound knowledge to the test.
